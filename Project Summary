This project includes descriptions of a process for pulling audit files from Google Drive and creating dashboards of student activity in Google Drive and Meet. The goal
of dashboards is to better understand how students are participating in online learning. And to determine quickly which students are participating
at low levels to direct intervention efforts.

I'm currently using a simple process of manually downloading audit files from G Suite and maintaining an aggregate file as a g sheet that 
feeds into a Google Data Studio Dashboard. The dashboard is then shared with School Administrators embedded in a Google Site.

The project is currently under development, with school leaders providing feedback and guidance on the most critical questions dashboads should
answer and the tasks they should support.
